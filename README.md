# Test_Grader_With_Pandas
Repo for Test Grading program that utilizes Pandas to present student results

This is a rudimentary program I made independent of tutorial videos to test my own knowledge of Pandas and Python dictionaries. 

This simple program takes user input from a "teacher" in the form of number of tests to grade, how many questions are on each test, each student's name
and their answers for each question. The program then calculates the grade of the student test by comparing the correct answers to the teacher test,
and stores the student name and their grade in a dictionary. The dictionary is then converted and printed as a Pandas dataframe so the teacher can easily
write down each student and their grade.
